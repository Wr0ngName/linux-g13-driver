# linux-g13-driver

I needed a way to get my Logitech G13 up and running fast, and I found this one.
I am running Linux Mint 17 x64. After a few teaking, it is running as expected,
and provides a quick workaround to the original drivers.

The drivers are no longer maintained by the original projects, I do not especially
intend to continue, as it is still working properly.

Thanks to Jim Gupta for the code (https://code.google.com/p/linux-g13-driver).
